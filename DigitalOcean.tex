\begin{cvletter}
    I recently learned that Digital Ocean is seeking a highly-motivated Software Engineer. I am excited to apply for this position because I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to the cloud. I am confident that with my previous experience and ability to pick up new technology quickly that I can hit the ground running and provide value at Digital Ocean.\\
    
    During my time at the Center for Applied Systems and Software (CASS) I advocated for and implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment. I've worked with several different CI providers including Azure, Circle CI, Travis and GitHub Actions. Some of the build pipelines were simple pipelines to build and deploy JavaScript Applications and some of the pipelines were for more complicated applications deployed using Kubernetes and Helm. I am confident that I can leverage this experience to meet the needs of the Engineering team at Digital Ocean.\\
    
    I may not have experience with GO but I am confident that I can hit the ground running and learn GO on the job. Through my experience at CASS I have proven that I can hit the ground running and provide value in short order. When I first started at CASS as a Systems Development Engineer I had little experience running and managing application development projects. However, I was able to hit the ground running and was still able to meet the needs of my clients shortly after being hired.\\ 
    
    During my experience at CASS one of our key clients was the (Oregon Department of Transportation). ODOT's software ran in dispatch centers around the state to dispatch resources to accidents and other road related events. Through working on this software I gained critical experience in writing fault tolerant code in a complicated system with many moving parts. I plan to use this experience at Digital Ocean to develop software capable of handling and recovering from faults.\\
    
    I am confident that my unique qualifications and background will add value to Digital Ocean. My experience Automating, Developing Fault tolerant code and learning quickly with be an asset to your organization. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my qualifications for the Software Engineer position at Digital Ocean. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
