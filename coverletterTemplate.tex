\begin{cvletter}
    I recently learned that CASS is looking for a highly-motivated Software Development Engineer. I am excited to apply for this position because I am confident that my communication skills along with a proven track record of leadership and hard work will be an asset to your team.\\
    
   I have been working working at CASS as a Student Developer since May of 2017. Through this experience I have become familiar with the technology and methodologies used at CASS. Through my time at CASS I have learned about many of the inner workings of CASS, including the technology stack, development methodologies and team dynamics.\\
    
   I've learned a lot about being an effective communicator and problem solver when working with current and potential clients. In the past I worked in property maintenance. Through this experience I gained practical experience working directly with clients to achieve the desired result. While coaching tennis I also learned to communicate effectively with parents, administration and students. Through my time at CASS I've been able to attend meetings, work with clients and help design applications. These experiences have enhanced my skills working and communicating with team members. \\
    
    While I still have goals to develop my management skills, I do have experience as a leader. In the past I've been a TA teaching business students about programming. I also coached high school tennis for several years. I believe this experience mentoring students will help me to be an effective leader and mentor.\\
    
    I am confident that my unique background will add value to your organization. My ability to work with students, clients and staff members to produce high level application solutions will be invaluable. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my qualifications for the Software Development Engineer position at CASS. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
