\begin{cvletter}
    I recently learned that CASS is looking for a highly-motivated Software Development Engineer. I am inquiring about this position at CASS because I think this would be a great opportunity to help your organization be more successful while allowing me to grow as an Engineer and a Leader.\\
    
    I'm a good candidate for this position because I have experience working at CASS as a Student Developer. Through this experience I have become familiar with the technology and methodologies used at CASS. Through my time at CASS I have learned about many of the inner workings of CASS. This includes the technology stack, development methodologies and team dynamics. This will make my transition into a staff position simple and seamless.\\
    
    I will be an effective communicator and problem solver when working with current and potential clients. In the past I worked in property maintenance. Through this experience I gained piratical experience working directly with clients. While coaching tennis I also learned to communicate effectively with parents, administration and students. Through my time at CASS I've been able to attend meetings, working with clients and help design applications.\\
    
    When it comes to project management I believe this is one area where I lack experience. However, throughout my time at OSU I've worked on many group projects where I've filled the role of group manger. In those projects I was able to asses my group mates skills and appropriately delegate work. I believe that I have some talent when it comes to managing teams that when given the chance to improve will become a powerful asset for your organization.\\
    
    I will also be able to leverage my past experience mentoring students to be an effective leader. In the past I've been a TA teaching business students about programming. I also coached high school tennis for several years. I believe this experience mentoring students will help me to be an effective leader and mentor.\\
    
    I am confident that my unique background will add value to your organization. My ability to work with students, clients and staff members to produce high level application solutions will be invaluable. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my qualification for the Software Development Engineer position at CASS. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
